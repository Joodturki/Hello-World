# Self-Introduction

Hello, my name is Jood Al Turki, and I am currently a level 6 Al student at IAU. I am very passionate about
artificial intelligence, especially in areas like machine learning and data analysis. I look forward to this course 
as it will help me deepen my understanding and improve my practical skills. I am excited to learn, collaborate with my classmates, and apply the knowledge I gain in real-world projects.
